<h4>About This Project</h4>

  "What to Eat" - is a recipe recommendation engine that suggests delicious recipes based on your dietary preferences and ingredients on hand, while also helping to reduce food waste. 🍴

<h4>Why is this problem valuable to address?</h4>

If you are like me, meal planning can be a challenge, especially when you have limited ingredients on hand or dietary restrictions to consider. "What to Eat" takes the guesswork out of meal planning and helps you find delicious recipes that fit your unique preferences and needs. 🍽️

<h4>Goals</h4>
By suggesting recipes based on the ingredients you already have at home, you can use up those items before they go bad and minimize the amount of food that gets thrown away. 🌍
<br></br>
I hope this project can help people find inspiration and joy in cooking at home. Please give it a try and let me know what you think! 🙌🏼

How to run on your own system:

- Once running, open a browser and open ``http://localhost:3000``

### Bug / Feature Request
- If there is a typo in the ingredients form, the result will not show properly, so user have to be very precise when inputting their items.
- Sometimes spoonacular api includes items that are not part of user's dietary requirements. 
- In the future, I am planning to include NLP in the ingredients form, so when user typed something that are not precise, the NLP can predict what user mean and fix those inputs.
- Another future enhancement will be adding a meal planning capabilities and add favorite meals.
